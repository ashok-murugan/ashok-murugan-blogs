# Ashok Murugan Blogs

Welcome to my personal blog collection. Here, I share insights on startups, technology, product management, and the hidden mechanics of the digital economy.

## 📚 Blog Posts

### [Minimum Viable Product: Engineering Wisdom That Beats Perfect Architecture](./minimum-viable-product-engineering-wisdom/README.md)
*Why MVPs win where clean architecture, funding, and talent often fail. A deep dive into intentional incompleteness and building products that should exist.*

### [White Labeling: The Shortcut That Teaches You More Than It Pays](./white-labeling-the-shortcut-that-teaches-you-more-than-it-pays/README.md)
*An exploration of the risks and rewards of white labeling, and why owning distribution is the only compounding asset.*

### [The Rise of the Product Engineer: Why Startups No Longer Need 'Full-Stack' Developers](./the-rise-of-the-product-engineer/README.md)
*Why the modern engineering frontier is moving away from technical layers towards product outcomes. A deep dive into the shift from full-stack to product-centric engineering.*

## 📖 Blog Structure Guidelines

### Directory Structure
Each blog post should follow this structure:
```
blog-post-slug/
├── README.md          # Main blog content
├── TOC.md            # Table of Contents
└── assets/           # Images and media
    ├── banner.png    # Main banner (required)
    └── *.png         # Additional images
```

### README.md Format

#### YAML Frontmatter (Required)
```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Title Here"
description: "A compelling one-liner that summarizes the post"
author: "Ashok Murugan"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", ...]
image: "assets/banner.png"
---
```

#### Content Structure
1. **Banner Image**
   ```html
   <p align="center">
     <img src="assets/banner.png" alt="Description" width="80%" />
   </p>
   ```

2. **Introduction Section**
   - Hook the reader immediately
   - Set up the problem or context
   - Use a compelling quote or insight

3. **Main Content Sections**
   - Use `## Heading` for major sections
   - Use `### Subheading` for subsections
   - Include relevant images with centered alignment

4. **Examples and Case Studies**
   - Real company examples engineers respect
   - Code snippets when relevant (use proper syntax highlighting)
   - Visual diagrams and illustrations

5. **Conclusion/Final Thought**
   - Actionable insights
   - Key takeaways
   - Optional: Resources for further reading

### TOC.md Format
Simple markdown table of contents with numbered sections and anchor links:
```markdown
## Table of Contents
1. [Introduction](#introduction)
2. [Main Section](#main-section)
   - [Subsection](#subsection)
3. [Conclusion](#conclusion)
```

### Image Guidelines

#### Banner Image
- **Size**: Wide format (16:9 or similar)
- **Style**: Professional, modern, minimal
- **Content**: Conceptual representation of the blog topic
- **No text**: Let the image speak visually

#### Section Images
- **Alignment**: Always center-aligned with 80% width
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive and meaningful
- **Style Consistency**: Maintain visual coherence across all images
- **File Format**: PNG preferred for diagrams, JPG for photos

#### Image Prompt Template (for AI generation)
When generating images, use prompts like:
```
[Type of image: diagram/illustration/concept art] showing [main subject].
[Visual style: minimal/modern/technical/flat design].
[Color palette: description].
[Additional details: perspective, elements, mood].
No text or labels unless specified.
```

**Examples (from MVP Blog):**
- *Banner:* "Minimal flat illustration of a simple CLI tool working successfully on a laptop screen in the foreground, while a large, complex system architecture diagram fades transparently in the background. Modern engineering aesthetic, muted color palette."
- *Conceptual Diagram:* "Clean technical diagram showing a simple linear flow: 'Assumption' (circle) → 'MVP' (square) → 'Reality' (hexagon) → 'Decision' (triangle). Minimalist line-art style with black lines on white background, technical blueprint aesthetic."
- *Comparison:* "Split comparison illustration showing two paths: Left side labeled 'Without MVP' shows confused engineers around a whiteboard with chaos. Right side labeled 'With MVP' shows focused team looking at clear data charts with upward trends."

### Content Writing Guidelines

#### Tone
- **Expert but accessible**: Write like you're explaining to a smart colleague
- **Human and conversational**: Avoid corporate jargon
- **Engineering-focused**: Use technical analogies and system thinking
- **Opinionated but balanced**: Take a stance, but acknowledge trade-offs

#### Structure
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 lines)
- Include bullet points for lists
- Add code blocks for technical examples
- Use blockquotes for key insights
- Break up text with images every 3-5 paragraphs

#### Technical Depth
- Assume software engineering background
- Include real-world examples (Airbnb, Stripe, etc.)
- Show code when relevant
- Reference architectural concepts naturally
- Balance theory with practical advice

### Best Practices
- ✅ Start with a compelling hook
- ✅ Use concrete examples over abstract theory
- ✅ Include visual breaks (images, diagrams, code)
- ✅ End with actionable insights
- ✅ Proofread for clarity and flow
- ✅ Check all image paths are correct
- ✅ Verify all anchor links in TOC work
